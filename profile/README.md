Living with a chronic disease is a daily challenge. Current treatments focus on managing the side effects rather than the illness itself. Most chronic diseases experience phases called flares where symptoms worsen and need control, and remission where the disease activity is controlled.

The goal of RemissionAI is to provide tools to help patients with chronic diseases manage their symptoms through AI supervision. thats through:

> Using AI to find what might cause symptom flares.

> Giving advice on managing symptoms based on each person’s health data.

> Monitoring health signs to stop problems before they get serious.

> Sending alerts for early action on severe symptoms.

> Helping patients live better with their condition.

RemissionAI is an open-source project . if you’re interested in collaboration, contributions or you have any questions, please email youssef@remissionai.com.
